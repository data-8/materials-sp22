Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",

Along that line, **DO NOT** reuse the variable names that we use when we grade your answers. For example, in Question 1 of the Global Poverty section we ask you to assign an answer to `latest`.

Although the world rate of extreme poverty has declined consistently for hundreds of years, the number of people living in extreme poverty is still over 600 million. The United Nations adopted an [ambitious goal](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/poverty/): \"By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere.\" In this part of the project we will examine aspects of global poverty that might affect whether the goal is achievable."
