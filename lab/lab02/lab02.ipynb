    "One important type of expression is the **call expression**. A call expression begins with the name of a function and is followed by the argument(s) of that function in parentheses. The function returns some value, based on its arguments. Some important mathematical functions are listed below.\n",

In this case, `2` and `5` are called **subexpressions** because they're expressions that are part of a larger expression.\n",

For example, if we called `farmers_markets_locations.sort(\"x\")`, then running `farmers_markets_locations` by itself would still return the unsorted table.\n",
