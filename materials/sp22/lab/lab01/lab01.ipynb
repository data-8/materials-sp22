    "# Lab 1: Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Data 8: *Foundations of Data Science*!  Each week you will complete a lab assignment like this one.  You can't learn technical subjects without hands-on practice, so labs are an important part of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, there are some administrative details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weekly lab sessions are designed to develop your skills with computational and inferential concepts. These lab assignments are a required part of the course and will be released on Monday nights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lab sessions are not webcast! Here are the policies for getting full credit:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To receive credit for the lab notebook (8% final grade), you must submit it by 5pm on the Friday the same week it was released.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To receive credit for the lab attendance (2% final grade), you must attend at least 5 out of the 12 labs. \n",
    "\n",
    "For Lab 1, however, you are **required** to attend lab and be checked off. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the Lab Queue at [lab.data8.org](https://lab.data8.org/). You can add yourself to the queue to get help from a GSI or academic intern! Please feel free to add yourself to the queue whenever you feel stuck or need some further clarification -- we are more than happy to help. \n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborating on labs is more than okay -- it's encouraged! You should rarely remain stuck for more than a few minutes on questions in labs, so ask an instructor or classmate for help. (Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it.) Please don't just share answers, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more of the [course policies](http://data8.org/sp22/policies.html) on the [course website](http://data8.org/sp22/).\n",

    "#### Today's lab\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's lab, you'll learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. navigate Jupyter notebooks (like this one);\n",
    "2. write and evaluate some basic *expressions* in Python, the computer language of the course;\n",
    "3. call *functions* to use code other people have written; and\n",
    "4. break down Python code into smaller parts to understand it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab covers parts of [Chapter 3](http://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/03/programming-in-python.html) of the online textbook. You should read the examples in the book, but not right now. Instead, let's get started!"
