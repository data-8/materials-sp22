The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for exams (and life). If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",

Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work! You might want to create your own checks along the way to see if your answers make sense. Additionally, before you submit, make sure that none of your cells take a very long time to run (several minutes).\n",

    "**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated task, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. Make sure that you are using distinct and meaningful variable names throughout the notebook. Along that line, **DO NOT** reuse the variable names that we use when we grade your answers. \n",

    "We can observe all of the February maximum temperatures from 2019 to 2021 (the present period), so we have access to the census; there's no random sampling involved. But, we can imagine that if more years pass with the same present-day climate, there would be different but similar maximum temperatures in future February days.

Treating actual observations of natural events as if they were each *randomly* sampled from some unknown distribution is a simplifying assumption. These temperatures were not actually sampled at random—instead they occurred due to the complex interactions of the Earth's climate—but treating them as if they were random abstracts away the details of this naturally occuring process and allows us to carry out statistical inference.  Conclusions are only as valid as the assumptions upon which they rest, but in this case thinking of daily temperatures as random samples from some unknown climate distribution seems at least plausible.\n",

We intend to compare our confidence interval to the historical average (ie. the `Past` value in our `monthly_increases` table). In all months, the sample average we will consider (i.e. the `Present` value in our `monthly_increases` table) is larger than the historical average. As a result, we know in advance that the upper bound of the confidence interval will be larger as well, and there is no need to compute the upper bound explicitly. (But you can if you wish!)"
